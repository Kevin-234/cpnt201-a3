## Summary
I used Figma to make SVG graphic. I drew number three by pen and added an icon bottom right on billiard ball.
I tried various color combinations to see which color suits this graphic. To give more option of color variation I added hue rotate property.
When click a button (Click Me!), button and graphic hue will rotate 180deg. First page and second page SVG graphic color are using different color.
You can enjoy other colors by enlarging or enlarging the screen
